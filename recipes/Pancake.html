    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. <br> This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are <br> probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk and butter</strong>: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-By-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li> Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
