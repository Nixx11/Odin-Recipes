    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.</p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-By-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking. </li>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
        <li>Press down on the flipped patties to sink the onions into the meat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add sliced mushrooms to the skillet used for the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Season patties with salt and pepper and place a slice of cheese on each. Cook until burgers have reached the desired doneness, 2 to 4 minutes more. Top each patty with leftover onion and mushrooms and serve on buns.</li>
    </ol>
